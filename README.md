# The Todo Plus #
This is the first project I'm making with the React framework, and I plan to modify it to have a backend and database linked to it as well for now.

## V 0.1 ##
# Current Functionalities #
Currently, the webapp uses an external npm library to display random motivational quotes.
It has a simple ToDo list

# Addition and Modifications Planned
1. Make the webpage responsive
2. Add animations and effects for better visual experience, improve the UI in general.
3. Connect the react page with a backend and use Mongoose and MongoDB to create a database which stores user data.
4. Add a feature that allows updation of tasks previously written.
5. Add a feature that allows the addition of subtasks within a task and tracks the progres based on completion of the subtasks.
6. Add a journaling feature, along with a date tracking functionality
7. Add a dark theme along with the current pastel theme.
8. (optional) add sign in options for users and shift the database online.
